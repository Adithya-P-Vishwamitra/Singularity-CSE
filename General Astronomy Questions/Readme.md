<h3>1. Calculate the angular resolution of a telescope with a 10-meter diameter mirror observing a binary star system at a wavelength of 550 nm. </h3>

Theta = 1.22 × Lambda / D<br>
Lambda = 550nm<br>
d = 10m<br>

Theta = (1.22 x 550 x 10^-9)/10<br>
Theta = **6.71 x 10^-8** radians

<h3>2. Compare and contrast the advantages and limitations of radio telescopes versus optical telescopes. Give a few examples of where you would use each.</h3>

<h4>Optical Telescopes</h4>
Use visible light to observe celestial objects.

Advantages: <br>
1.High resolution <br>
2.Data is in visible range so it is easy to understand.<br>
3.Good for observing stars, planets, and galaxies with clear structural detail.

Limitations:<br>
Affected by weather and atmosphere<br>
Only usable at night<br>
Can't detect infrared, ultraviolet, or radio emissions<br>

Use cases: <br>
1.Observing planets, stars, galaxies.<br>
2.Studying stellar explosions , supernova<br>
3.Analyzing light spectra for composition and redshift.<br>

<h4> Radio Telescopes:</h4>
Detect radio waves emitted by celestial objects.

Advantages:<br>
1.Can observe day and night <br>
2.Unaffected by weather <br>
3.Can detect cool gas clouds, pulsars, quasars, and the cosmic microwave background.<br>

Limitations
1.Lower resolution 
2.Requires large dish sizes to compensate for resolution loss.
3.More prone to human interference like cell phones and radars

Use cases:
1.Mapping hydrogen gas in galaxies.
2.Studying pulsars, black holes, and quasars.
3.Observing the early universe (cosmic microwave background).
4.SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence).

<h2>3. Explain the concept of the event horizon of a black hole. In your explanation, include: what happens to space-time at this boundary, why it's called a "point of no return”. </h2>

<p>A black hole is an area in space where gravity is so powerful that nothing including light cannot escape. Around every black hole is something known as the event horizon. Imagine an invisible line or edge. Once something passes that boundary, it's lost forever because the gravity beyond that point is so strong that there isn't any force in the universe that can pull it back out. 

The event horizon is referred to as the "point of no return" because once you cross it, you cannot come back. At the event horizon , space-time gets wrapped by gravity.  As you approach the event horizon, time for you slows down compared to someone far away. At the boundary, time seems to stop entirely from the outside viewer’s perspective. After crossing the event horizon you can only move in one direction that is inwards

Inside the event horizon is the black hole's core known as singularity where even the laws of physics don't withstand a chance. Since even light cannot escape it , till date we are not able to observe what happens inside
